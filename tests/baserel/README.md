# Base-relative C++ repro (os32-gcc16)

`build.sh` builds `t3_threads.cpp` plain, with `-fbaserel32` and with `-fbaserel`.
Seen on daletop on 12 October 2026 (stove from openamigagcc main f9efa3d, AmigaOS 3.2.3 lab, AC090 68040):

| Build | Link | On the Amiga |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plain | OK | `t3 OK`, rc 0 |
| `-fbaserel32` | OK, with 25 lines `.data.rel.local.LDFCM0 reloc for .data.rel.local.LDFCM0 is out of range: 00000000` | hangs before printing anything; the task waits on signal `80000000` (received `00000100`) |
| `-fbaserel` | fails: `libnix.a(cxxglue.o): in function '__init_eh': relocation truncated to fit: DREL16 against '.list___EH_FRAME_BEGIN'` (plus the same 25 lines) | — |

The `LDFCM` sections are not FPU constants: they are 4-byte pointers to exception typeinfo, which `.gcc_except_table` reaches with a 32-bit PC-relative relocation across hunks (see `FINDINGS.md`, B). GCC 0011 fixes that (below).

With libnix 0007, aros-stuff 0005 and the base-relative `libos32compat` builds (amigachrome-stoves #7: `compat/libb`, `compat/libb32`), `-fbaserel32` and `-fbaserel` both print `t3 OK`. `build.sh` links each variant with the matching compat archive.

## Catch by type (GCC 0011)

`catch.cpp` throws and catches by type five ways: its own struct, `std::out_of_range` from `vector::at`, a base-class match after a non-matching handler, derived by base, and a rethrow. `eh-check.sh PREFIX` links it `-fbaserel32`, `-resident32` and `-fbaserel` and fails on any "out of range" line, or on an LDFCM section in the base-relative libstdc++ and libsupc++; CI runs it.

On the Amiga (lab copy of Instance-32, 12 October 2026): with 0011, plain, `-fbaserel32`, `-resident32` and `-fbaserel` all print five PASS lines and `catch OK`, rc 0. Without it, `-fbaserel32` prints "Program aborted" and hangs.
